## **üìúIntroduction**
* In this project we coded from scratch an AirBnb clone.
* This is the first phase of the Airbnb Clone: the console. This repository holds a command interpreter and classes (i.e. BaseModel class and several other classes that inherit from it: Amenity, City, State, Place, Review), and a command interpreter. The command interpreter, like a shell, can be activated, take in user input, and perform certain tasks to manipulate the object instances.

## **üí°Synopsis**
The application begins in console.py, which calls an instance of the FileStorage class in __init__.py. This class manages all files within the storage system. For file operations, the FileStorage class calls methods from the base_model.py and file_storage.py scripts, each responsible for different aspects of the system.

## **üíΩProject**

### **üìëPython Scripts Requirements**
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
  - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
  - Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
  - All your files must be executable
  - The length of your files will be tested using wc
  - All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
  - All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
  - All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c       '       'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
  - A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### **üìëPython Unit Tests Requirements**
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - All your test files should be inside a folder tests
  - You have to use the unittest module
  - All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
  - All your test files and folders should start by test_
  - Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
  - e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
  - e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
  - All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
  - You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
  - All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
  - All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
  - All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c   '           'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

#### **üíªInteractive mode**

  - The console should work like this in interactive mode:
```
    $ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================

(hbnb) 

(hbnb) 

(hbnb) quit
$
```
    
#### **üíªNon-Interactive mode**

  $ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

========================================

EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)

$

$ cat test_help

help

$

$ cat test_help | ./console.py
